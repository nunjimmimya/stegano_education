steganography using imagemagick for educational purposes

- this is for my final year project based on imagemagick
- running on OSX
- must install imagemagick via port because i hardcoded it with full path (sorry) ;)

the concept is quite simple
1. user login to the system
2. put their image and their so-called copyright
3. then the 4 image will appear (uploaded file, stegano embedded file, stegano complete embedded file, key file)
4. save to DB
5. view your uploaded image
6. check the image for authenticancy
