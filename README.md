steganography using imagemagick for educational purposes

- this is for my final year project based on imagemagick
- running on OSX
- must install imagemagick via port because i hardcoded it with full path (sorry) ;)

the concept is quite simple<br />
1. user login to the system<br />
2. put their image and their so-called copyright<br />
3. then the 4 image will appear (uploaded file, stegano embedded file, stegano complete embedded file, key file)<br />
4. save to DB<br />
5. view your uploaded image<br />
6. check the image for authenticancy<br />
